    "# Task 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate the expected lifetime, after surgery, of a woman who survives the first 12 months following surgery, but whose breast cancer has also reappeared within the first 12 months, either locally or distant.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint:_ Use rejection sampling. Simulate a number of women, and discard all simulations that do not meet the requirements. Do this until you have reached 1000 acceptable simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Just to make it more clear the 5 states are the following:\n",
    "1. Women with breast tumor removed, and are healty.\n",
    "2. Cancer reappears locally (cancer reappears close to the removed tumor).\n",
    "3. Cancer reappears distant from where it was operated (called distant metastatis).\n",
    "4. Cancer both reappears locally and distant at same time.\n",
    "5. Death.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are asked to estimate the expected lifetime, after surgery, of women who survive first 12 months but have entered state 2 or state 3 within the first 12 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We made the assumption that it was either state 2 or 3 that had to have appeared in the first 12 months, so we don't consider state 4 where the women has both a local and distant reappearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented in the code below:"
